<p>A soon to be launched attempt to create a open and free<a href="#1">ยน</a> implementation in java. </p>

<p>Initially it will consist of just a <a href="open-gdsn">core project</a>, focussing om provide 'better' standards in the sence that they can be more effectively used in a technical (=executable) way
<ul>
  <li>All GDSN Global validation rules  in a Schematron annotated set of XSD's (including conditionally required fields)</li>
  <li>Checks against codelists and/or allowed values</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Later on, it could be that this 'better standard' will be incorporated in a semi-end-user oriented framework with a api's to communicate with existing systems like
<ul>
<li>DataSource client (non-ui) for communicating with a certified SourceDataPool that supports the GDSN flow of messages</li>
<li>DataRecipient client (non-ui) for communicating with a certified RecipientDataPool that supports the GDSN flow of messages</li>
</ul>
or maybe even fully end-user oriented products
<ul>
<li>DataRecipient UI extending the DataRecipient client</li>
<li>DataSource UI extending the DataSource client</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Both clients should then of course be based on a the same code and should support:</p>

<ul>
<li>A view for all GDSN fields</li>
<li>Sending (DataSource) or receiving (DataRecipient) CIN messages</li>
<li>Sending (DataSource) CIP messages</li>
<li>Sending (DataRecipient) or receiving (DataSource) CIC messages</li>
<li>Sending (DataRecipient) CIS messages</li>
<li>Customize views based on target market</li>
<li>Customize validations (Global, targetMarket based, or fully custom)</li>
<li>Adding custom fields for internal use that won't get send to the datapool</li>
<li>Allowing to import data from a backoffice and add/populate additional fields before sending the data to the DataPool (merging) and keeping the added data in tact after an additional import</li>
<li>Running in a 'mixed mode' configuration so wholesale companies can receive data from the datapool and use that data to forward it to their retailers</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course all basic things you expect from a solution like this are supported</p>

<ul>
<li>searching</li>
<li>filtering</li>
<li>exporting</li>
<li>mass-update fields</li>
<li>status overview</li>
<li>error reporting </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="future-ideas" class="anchor" href="#future-ideas" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future ideas</h3>

<p>We think all the above is a great basis for a usable solution, but we certainly already have ideas for the future</p>

<ul>
<li>support for templating</li>
<li>saving/using custom filters</li>
<li>fully dynamic views based on e.g. GPC code</li>
<li>ability to send data to different datapools</li>
<li>support import mappings so custom formats can be uploaded</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h3>

<p>The idea is that after an initial release of the DataSource and DataRecipient parts, a real full blown GSDSN compliant DataPool will be implemented too. One of the biggest challenges for this will be the costly <a href="https://www.drummondgroup.com/b2b-certified-products/b2b-standards/gdsn">Drummond certification</a> that is required by GS1. We are interested in anyone or (almost) any company that is interested in crowdfunding, sponsoring or helping out</p>
