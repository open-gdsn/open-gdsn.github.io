{"name":"open-gdsn","tagline":"","body":"###open-gdsn##\r\nA soon to be launched attempt to create a open and free¹ implementation in java. \r\n\r\nInitially it will consist of \r\n\r\n - DataSource client (non-ui) for communicating with a certified SourceDataPool that supports the GDSN flow of messages\r\n - DataSource UI extending the DataSource client\r\n - DataRecipient client (non-ui) for communicating with a certified RecipientDataPool that supports the GDSN flow of messages\r\n - DataRecipient UI extending the DataRecipient client\r\n \r\nBoth clients will be based on a the same code and will initially support:\r\n\r\n - All GDSN Global validation rules (including conditionally required fields or allowed values)\r\n - A view for all GDSN fields\r\n - Sending (DataSource) or receiving (DataRecipient) CIN messages\r\n - Sending (DataSource) CIP messages\r\n - Sending (DataRecipient) or receiving (DataSource) CIC messages\r\n - Sending (DataRecipient) CIS messages\r\n - Customize views based on target market\r\n - Customize validations (Global, targetMarket based, or fully custom)\r\n - Adding custom fields for internal use that won't get send to the datapool\r\n - Allowing to import data from a backoffice and add/populate additional fields before sending the data to the DataPool (merging) and keeping the added data in tact after an additional import\r\n - Running in a 'mixed mode' configuration so wholesale companies can receive data from the datapool and use that data to forward it to their retailers\r\n \r\nOf course all basic things you expect from a solution like this are supported\r\n\r\n - searching\r\n - filtering\r\n - exporting\r\n - mass-update fields\r\n - status overview\r\n - error reporting \r\n \r\n###Future ideas###\r\n\r\nWe think all the above is a great basis for a usable solution, but we certainly already have ideas for the future\r\n \r\n  - support for templating\r\n  - saving/using custom filters\r\n  - fully dynamic views based on e.g. GPC code\r\n  - ability to send data to different datapools\r\n  - support import mappings so custom formats can be uploaded\r\n\r\n###Goal###\r\n\r\nThe idea is that after an initial release of the DataSource and DataRecipient parts, a real full blown GSDSN compliant DataPool will be implemented too. One of the biggest challenges for this will be the costly [Drummond certification](https://www.drummondgroup.com/b2b-certified-products/b2b-standards/gdsn) that is required by GS1\r\n\r\n¹ for non commercial companies/usage \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
